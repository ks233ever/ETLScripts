## KubeFlow is a Machine Learning toolkit that runs on top of Kubernetes

These projects were implemented using Google Cloud Platform as a part of this [course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-end-to-end-machine-learning-workflows-kubeflow/table-of-contents). You can also deploy Kubeflow on an AWS EKS cluster, or within [Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/amazon-sagemaker-components-kubeflow-pipelines/)
