## Using KFserving

* Supports common frameworks such as sci-kit learn, pytorch, xgboost, custom models, etc.
* Supports canary rollouts and model A/B testing
* Integrates with other performance monitoring frameworks
* Integrates pre and post-processing logic in the serving layer
* Provides model explainability for predictions it's making
* Auto scales up or down depending on traffic

**Demo_1** is an example of KFserving where we serve the model as an API, include pre and post-processing, and invoke the API for prediction
**Demo_2** is an example of a canary rollout
