## Using KFserving

* Supports common frameworks such as sci-kit learn, pytorch, xgboost, custom models, etc.
* Can do canary rollouts and model A/B testing
* Can integrate with other performance monitoring frameworks
* Can integrate pre and post-processing logic in the serving layer
* Provides model explainability for predictions it's making

**Demo_1** is an example of KFserving where we serve the model as an API, include pre and post-processing, and invoke the API for prediction
