### Kubeflow pipeline in notebook

Build and deploy the KubeFlow pipeline from terminal or within a KubeFlow notebook

* Here we use KubeFlow notebook to construct a pipeline that:
  * Runs hyper-parameter tuning
  * Extracts optimal hyper-parameter
  * Trains using optimal hyper-parameter
  * Serves the trained model, see also *Model_Serving*
  
- Make changes: `export_dir`, `image name` etc.
- Run cells to create experiement and run
