**Deploy a custom CNN Model as an endpoint via Sagemaker**

1. Save model weights and architecture
2. Export the model to TensorFlow ProtoBuf format
3. Create prediction signature to be used by TensorFlow serving predict API
4. Convert TensorFlow model to SageMaker readable format
5. Deploy the trained model as a live endpoint

See DataScience-AI/DeepLearning/CNN_Diabetic_Retinopathy to view the code used to create the model
